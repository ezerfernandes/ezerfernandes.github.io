I don't understand why sources of data as rich as financial statements are not shown more often as charts. I guess accountants are used to read them just as tables, but I believe visualizing them in other ways can be very insightful. I want to show here some possibilities for visualizing financial statements.

FIrst of all, studies starting at 1984, with [William S. Cleveland and Robert McGill](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2288400.pdf), have demonstrated that certain dimensions are better perceived by humans than others; for example, length is better discerned than area. Below is a nice table showing this that I copied from [this article](https://knowablemagazine.org/article/mind/2019/science-data-visualization):
