        <h1>Ezer's homepage</h1>
        <p>That's my personal homepage. I want to keep it simple and small. I'm going to write some articles here, that you can copy, just cite the source and point a link to here. Things that are of my interest: programming, ancient history and other things. Follow me on twitter: @<a href="https://twitter.com/ezerfernandes">ezerfernandes</a></p>
