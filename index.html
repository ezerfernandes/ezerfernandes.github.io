<div class="blurb">
	<p>My name is Ezer Fernandes, I am a programmer and data scientist and I love trying out new things. I am also a proud dad and a happy husband.</p>
	<p>This is my personal homepage. I want to keep it simple and small. I'm going to write some articles that you can copy, just cite the source and point a link to it. Things that are of my interest: programming, maths, music, investing and history.</p>
