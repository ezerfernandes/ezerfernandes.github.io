	<p>My name is Ezer Fernandes, I am a programmer and data scientist. I am also a proud dad and a happy husband.</p>
	<p>This is my personal homepage. I want to keep it simple and small. I'll share notes, blog posts and other things with the main goal of helping me think better on subjects close to my heart. You can copy it, just cite the source and point a link to it. Some of the hings that are of my interest: programming, data science, investing, math, music, history, biblical exegesis and thinking in general.</p>
