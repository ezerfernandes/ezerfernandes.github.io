<div class="blurb">
        <p>That's my personal homepage. I want to keep it simple and small. I'm going to write some articles that you can copy, just cite the source and point a link to here. Things that are of my interest: programming, maths and other things.</p>
        <p>My name is Ezer Fernandes, I am a programmer, data scientist and I love always trying out new things. I am also a dad, a husband and I like playing music, ancient history and investing.</p>
